#+TITLE: Ruby Source Code Notes

* Intro
These are my notes for the Ruby source code. I hope to document my
attempts to understand the Ruby code.

* Globals
- <<Qundef>> ~Qundef~ --- (?) A magic number that represents undefined
  
* Helper Functions/Macros
- <<has_delayed_token>> ~has_delayed_token~ --- For Ruby parser,
  always false

* Types
- <<~parser_params~>> ~parser_params~ --- Oh boy, this is a complicated
  one. Consists of a massive struct that contains:
  - A [[rb_imemo_tmpbuf_t][~rb\_imemo\_tmpbuf\_t~]] pointer called heap (so
    I'm guessing this is just the heap/free list for the parser?).
  - A [[YYSTYPE][~YYSTYPE~]] pointer called ~lval~
  - A struct called [[lex][~lex~]]
  - Two ~stack_type~, i.e. [[VALUE][~VALUE~]]'s called ~cond_stack~ and
    ~cmdarg_stack~
  - A bunch of ~int~'s:
    - ~tokidx~
    - ~toksiz~
    - ~tokline~
    - ~heredoc_end~
    - ~heredoc_indent~
    - ~heredoc_line_indent~
    - ~line_count~
    - ~ruby_sourceline~


- <<~VALUE~>> ~VALUE~ --- ~uintptr_t~
- <<yytokentype>> ~yytokentype~
- <<YYSTYPE>> ~YYSTYPE~ --- 
- <<rb_imemo_tmpbuf_t>> ~rb_imemo_tmpbuf_t~ --- A linked list with a payload consisting of
  two [[~VALUE~]]'s: ~flags~ and ~reserved~ and a ~VALUE~ pointer
  called....~ptr~ which apparently is a malloc'd buffer. Also has a
  ~size_t~ called ~cnt~ which is the size of that buffer. Finally has
  a pointer to another ~rb_imemo_tmpbuf_struct~ called ~next~.

* Lexer

- <<yylex>> ~yylex~ --- A wrapper for [[parser_yylex][~parser\_yylex~]] with some extra
  options. Initializes a [[yytokentype][~yytokentype~]]. Assigns ~p~, a struct of
  [[~parser\_params~]] an [[lval][~lval~]] (with type [[YYSTYPE][~YYSTYPE~]]) and gives ~lval~ a
  ~val~ of [[Qundef][~Qundef~]]. (I guess initializing ~p~ with an empty ~lval~?)
  Then calls [[parser_yylex][~parser\_yylex~]] with ~p~ and assigns the result to the
  ~yytokentype~ variable. If [[has_delayed_token][~has\_delayed\_token~]] (never in Ruby
  parser) then call ~dispatch_delayed_token~. Else if ~parser\_yylex~
  returns 0 then call ~dispatch_scan_event~, which, uh, in Ruby parser
  does nothing (well, it casts 0 to void).
- <<parser_yylex>> ~parser_yylex~ ---

* Terminals
- <<~kALIAS~>> --- ~alias~
- <<~tGVAR~>> --- Global variable
- <<~tBACK_REF~>> --- ~$+~, ~$&~, ~$`~, ~$\~
- <<~tNTH_REF~>> --- ~$1~, ~$2~...
- 
* Grammar Rules
- ~program~ --- Just the top level rule. Alias for [[top_comp_stmt][~top\_compstmt~]]
- <<top_compstmt>> ~top_compstmt~ --- Again just [[top_stmts][~top\_stmts~]] with an
  [[opt_terms][~opt\_terms~]] add on.
- <<top_stmts>> ~top_stmts~ --- Either nothing, one single [[~top_stmt~]] or a 
- <<~mlhs~>> ~mlhs~ --- Either [[~mlhs_basic~]] or essential [[~mlhs_basic~]]
  in parenthesis. Pretty sure this is just any infix expression.
